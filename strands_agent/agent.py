strands_agent/agent.py

This module defines a simple Strands-based agent that uses the default mem0 memory
implementation.  It is provided as a starting point for integrating with
rLLM's AgentWorkflowEngine.  You need to have the `strands` library installed
in your Python environment.

Example usage:

    from strands_agent.agent import build_agent
    agent = build_agent()

Then pass ``agent`` to an rLLM workflow engine for inference and evaluation.
