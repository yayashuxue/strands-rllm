strands_agent/memory/mem1_stub.py

This module provides a stub class for a MEM1-like memory tool.  Use this as a
starting point to integrate the MEM1 internal state update mechanism into a
Strands agent.  The MEM1 algorithm trains a language model to maintain a
compact internal state that consolidates past observations and reasoning.

To use this stub:
  1. Implement the ``recall`` and ``update`` methods to interact with your MEM1 model.
  2. Load your trained MEM1 model in the constructor (``__init__``) if necessary.
  3. Modify ``strands_agent/agent.py`` to instantiate ``Mem1Memory`` instead of
     the default Mem0Memory.

    A stub for a MEM1-style memory plugin.

    This class should maintain a compact internal state (e.g. a fixed-size token
    sequence) that gets updated at each interaction step.  The ``recall`` method
    returns relevant information from the state, and the ``update`` method
    combines the current state with new observations and model reasoning.
